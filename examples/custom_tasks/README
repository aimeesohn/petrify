An example project demonstrating the views rendering system and data loading.
This can be used to generate any number of pages from markdown or json data.

With this set up, you can just add a new markdown file to the data
directory and run "tea build" to add new blog posts to the example site.

Notice that one of the views uses a module from NPM (underscore), installed
to the node_modules directory. Views are just regular Node.js modules.
